# MHF-QuestEditor
For creating and modifying quest for MH:F

Most of all the UI Work is all done for creating the quest alongside most of the codes. 
reading quest is working too.
Just need to work on writing back all the data.

Syncing the work to save my progress at this time.
Lots of images and other work still needs to be added for everything to be fluid.

Put assets folder into main program location, or else it will crash.
